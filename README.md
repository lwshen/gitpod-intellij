## Gitpod Intellij
I think gitpod is an interesting concept. But alot of the work I do is in Java. I recently have been experimenting with [JetBrains Projector](https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2021/03/11/projector-is-out/) and have found it pretty workable.  I wanted to try and get projector working with gitpod.  I found [this post](https://community.gitpod.io/t/running-phpstorm-through-projector-in-gitpod/2760/4) in the community forums.  I adapted the PhpStorm installation from[here](https://github.com/shaal/ddev-gitpod#do-you-like-phpstorm-instead-of-theia-or-vscode) to work with IDEA.  To open this in gitpod.io use this link: [Gitpod-Intellij](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/rmchale/gitpod-intellij)
