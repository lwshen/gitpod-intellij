## Gitpod Intellij
I adapted the PhpStorm installation [here](https://github.com/shaal/ddev-gitpod#do-you-like-phpstorm-instead-of-theia-or-vscode) to work with IDEA.  To open this in gitpod.io use this link: [Gitpod-Intellij](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/rmchale/gitpod-intellij) 

## Launch Intellij
To launch intellij run the following

```
./intellij.sh &
